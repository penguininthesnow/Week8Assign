第一階段研究專案(week8)

## Task1 - HTML <script> Attributes -- <br> There are 2 attributes, defer and async , that we can use in <script> tag to change the script loading and executing behavior.
Q1-1: What happens if we add a defer attribute to a <script>tag? <br>
A1-1:

Q1-2: What happens if we add a async attribute to a <script>tag? <br>
A1-2:

Q1-3: When to use these 2 attributes? Could you give us code examples to illustrate the use cases for these 2 attributes? <br>
A1-3:

## Task2 - CSS Selector Naming -- OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM are 3 common naming guidelines for CSS Selector. These guidelines help us write more readable CSS code.
Q2-1: Introduce the concepts of OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM naming guidelines. <br>
A2-1:

Q2-2: Tell us which naming guideline is your favorite, and give an example to demonstrate the main concept of that guideline. For example, you can demo how to apply the OOCSS naming guideline to the CSS code in our week 1 tasks. <br>
A2-2:

## Task3- Fetch and CORS --  
Using built-in JavaScript fetch function, we can send HTTP requests to the back-end and get HTTP responses without refreshing or redirecting the page. Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) concept plays a critical role if we want to send a request to a different domain with the fetch function.
Q3-1: What is CORS? <br>
A3-1: 

Q3-2: Can we use the fetch function in our localhost page, to send a request to https://www.google.com/ and get a response?
A3-2:

Q3-3: Can we use the fetch function in our localhost page, to send a request to https://cwpeng.github.io/test/assignment-3-1 and get a response? Compared to the previous case, what’s the difference?
A3-3:

Q3-4: How to share APIs we developed to other domains, just like what we experienced in step 3. Could you give us an example?
A3-4:

## Task4 - Connection Pool -- The standard procedure to work with databases is: connect, execute SQL statements, and finally close the connection. Connection Pool is a programming technique to make the connection between back-end system and database more stable, and increase overall throughput.
Q3-1: What is Connection Pool? Why do we want to use Connection Pool?
A3-1:

Q3-2: How to create a Connection Pool by the official mysql-connector-python package?
A3-2:

Q3-3: If we want to make database operations, we get a connection from Connection Pool, execute SQL statements, and finally return connection back to the Connection Pool. Demo your code which implements the above procedure.
A3-3:

## Task5 - Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) -- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common attack methods. Try to study the basic concept, replicate the attack steps, and tell us how to prevent this kind of attack from the developer’s view.
Q5-1: What is XSS?
A5-1:

Q5-2: You are a hacker! Design and do a real XSS attack on a web system. Show us your work.
A5-2:

Q5-3: Based on the scenario you did in the previous step, how could it be prevented?
A5-3:
